<h1> Pomodoro-Timer </h1>
A Pomodoro timer is a learning aid that allows for sections of focus. There are variants with different work and break times, but I am using 50 minute of work, and then 10 minutes of break. Just enough work to get a lot done, but enough break to not burn out.  

The decided to work on this as I would like a timer that doesn't rely on the internet, I could look at when I need to, and there is no distractions with using websites or ads with youtube. And also to gain more experience with python and problem solving.
